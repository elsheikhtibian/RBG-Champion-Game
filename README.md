# RBG-Champion-Game

The "Battle of Champions" is a command-line game that simulates a battle between two players' teams of champions. Each player has a set of champions with different roles and levels, and they engage in battles over a series of rounds. The project is designed to provide an exciting and interactive gaming experience.
